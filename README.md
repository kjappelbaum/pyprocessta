# pyprocessta

> Making the analysis of data from chemical engineering processes boring again!

`pyprocessta` is a suite of tools that aims to help chemical engineers with the analysis of their time series. `pyprocessta` provides tools for the following steps

- exploratory data analysis
- data cleaning
- time series modeling
- causal impact analysis

## Installation

Development version

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/kjappelbaum/pyprocessta.git
```

## Reproducing the analysis in "Deep learning for industrial processes: Forecasting amine emissions from a carbon capture plant"

For the notebooks and scripts we used in this work, see the `paper` directory.
